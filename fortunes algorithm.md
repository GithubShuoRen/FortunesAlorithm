# Fortune's Algorithm

**Fortune's algorithm** is a [sweep line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm) for generating a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) from a set of points in a plane using [O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)(*n* log *n*) time and O(*n*) space.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm#cite_note-Mark2000-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm#cite_note-2)



 events may include:

1. **the addition of another parabola** to the beach line (when the sweep line crosses another input point) 

2. the **removal** of a curve from the beach line (when the sweep line becomes tangent to a circle through some three input points whose parabolas form consecutive segments of the beach line).
